      <p>
        Groupers are <span class="importante">teleosts</span> (ray-finned
        fishes), typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They can be
        quite large, and
        <span class="importante">lengths over a meter</span> and
        <span class="importante">weights up to 100 kg</span> are not uncommon,
        though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They
        <span class="importante">swallow prey</span> rather than biting pieces
        off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they
        have <span class="importante">heavy crushing tooth plates</span> inside
        the pharynx. They habitually eat
        <span class="importante">fish, octopuses, and crustaceans</span>.
        Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the giant
        grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their mouths and gills form a
        <span class="importante">powerful sucking system</span> that sucks their
        prey in from a distance. They also use their
        <span class="importante">mouths to dig</span> into sand to form their
        shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their
        <span class="importante">gills</span>. Their gill muscles are so
        powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out of a cave if they
        feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in.
